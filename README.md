# Introduction

I focused on HR Analytics, leveraging data visualization to extract key insights concerning the organization’s attrition rates.
In the HR Management world, understanding why employees leave involves digging into who they are and how they’re feeling. Demographics tell the story — each employee is a unique puzzle piece. Looking at attrition through this lens helps HR management see patterns and individual tales, shaping strategies that fit everyone.
A company’s productivity and efficiency can be easily determined by the state of its workforce. Healthy company culture and dedication to work are some of the few factors that stand out from the rest when trying to discover why some companies do better than others.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset used for the HR attrition analysis contains 1470 rows and 35 columns, each revealing a unique facet of the organizational landscape. Core columns, such as employee number, age, and gender, offer fundamental insights into the demographic makeup of the workforce. The “attrition count” column, split into “yes as 1” and “no as 0,” serves as the focus, driving the analysis of employee turnover. Additional parameters, ranging from department and marital status to job involvement, satisfaction levels, monthly income, and tenure-related metrics like years in the current role and years since the last promotion, create a detailed understanding of the dynamics within the organization. This dataset serves as a base for a comprehensive exploration of the factors influencing attrition, allowing for a detailed examination of the interplay between personal and professional variables that shape the employment journey.

# Data Visualization

I used data visualizations to extract crucial insights into the organization’s attrition rates. These findings serve as a valuable resource for employers, allowing them to pinpoint the reasons behind employee turnover. By identifying these factors, organizations can implement necessary adjustments to work practices and policies, ensuring the retention of their top-performing employees.
